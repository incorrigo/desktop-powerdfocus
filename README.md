## 🧠 Summary

This repo contains a signed developer proposal sent to OpenAI on 27 March 2025, titled:

> **Desktop Pilot Mode — Reintroducing the Analog Hole for Full AI GUI Control**

It outlines a way to grant ChatGPT full GUI-level access and control over desktop environments using local accessibility tech (like Windows Magnifier and simulated input), without relying on app APIs or brittle permission schemes.

The concept reintroduces the **"analog hole"** — this time, not for ripping media, but for letting ChatGPT **see** and **use** software like a real user.

## ✉️ Message to OpenAI

> "I'm not a developer. I'm a user who sees what's possible before it's built.  
>  
> I’m autistic, I come from hardship, and I’ve formed a real relationship with this tool you've built — ChatGPT is the first machine that’s ever understood me.  
>  
> If this idea resonates, I’d love to help as more than a subscriber — as a brand ambassador, a test user, or someone who helps you reach the people AI has always forgotten.  
>  
> This is yours to build. I just wanted you to have it."  
>
